# Arduino-sonar-scanner
A sonar scanner that uses an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and an Arduino Uno.

## Hardware
- Arduino
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Servo Motor
- 3 leds of different color
- 3*220 Ohm resistors
- 1 buzzer + resistor for buzzer (if needed)
- Jumper wires

## Setup
Connect the sensor and the servo to any digital pins. Ensure that the servo is connected to a digital pin with PWM (pulse-width modulation). Connect the 3 leds and buzzers to digital pins as well (again, make sure the buzzer is connected to a pin with PWM). 

## Software
Credits to Robonyx for 90% of the code. I edited it based on my pins and stuff.
